# rps
Rock paper scissors game

I built this game as part of a learning project, deciding to use mostly pure Javascript over jQuery. jQuery is used in dabs, but most of the main logic for the game is done using pure javascript.

To install:

1: clone the repository
2: npm install (having gulp/sass installed globally may help as well)
3: run gulp
4: open localhost:8000
